The DriverPass project was a program meant to increase the success rate of new drivers in training. 
The clients are individuals looking to get a drivers license. The system we created needed to be simple, accessible on multiple platforms and available offline. 
In this assignment, I would like to improve my UML sequence diagram. I feel like I left out a lot of material that was critical to the creation of DriverPass.
I would like to go back and add more features to each variable that made up the diagram.
When interpreting the users needs, any input received was strongly recognized, considered, and implemented wherever possible.
This consideration is imperative to show the users that they are appreciated and that we will continue to make upgrades and adjustments wherever needed. 
When designing software, the inclusion of various diagrams helps to keep everybody on the same page. 
Regardless of their programming background. Use Case, Activity, Class, or Sequence diagrams help to break every aspect down and simplify what can be complicated to unfamiliar eyes.
